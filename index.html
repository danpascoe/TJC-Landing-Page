                <h3>Industry Specific Roadshows</h3>
                <p>Industries that we have successfully covered in the last 16 years include Defence & Aerospace, Automotive, Rail, Oil & Gas and Medical Device Technology. We believe our roadshows are by far the best way to connect face to face with Engineering, Purchasing and Senior Management directly on their premises. As one of 20 companies you will enjoy the economies of scale as our tours are very competitively priced delivering so much more than the traditional trade show. So why not do something a bit different in 2021? Something that is unique, innovative, and exciting. Your stand is already in place, all we require is your artwork and then you can come and meet all those lovely Engineers that don’t go to trade shows anymore!</p>
